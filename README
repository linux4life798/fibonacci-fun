A couple programs and scripts that calculate the n'th fibonacci number using different methods.

To use, just run "make" in the working directory.

You will now have the following four executables:

* fib     - uses standard recursion ( fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1) )                                     - (Generally Slowest)
* fib-th  - uses the previous recursive method, but from two different threads                           - (Generally Faster)
* fib-lin - simply calculates all of the finonacci numbers up to the requested fibonacci number (linear) - (Fastest)

* fib.sh  - uses standard recursion (shell script using /bin/sh)
