A collection of programs and scripts that calculate the n'th fibonacci number
using different methods and languages. The primary intent is to simply serve
as an example of different languages.

To use, just run "make" in the working directory.

You will now have the following four executables:

* fib       - uses standard recursion ( fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1) )                                     - (Generally Slowest)
* fib-th    - uses the previous recursive method, but from two different threads                           - (Generally Faster)
* fib-lin   - simply calculates all of the fibonacci numbers up to the requested fibonacci number (linear) - (Fastest)

* fib.sh    - uses standard recursion (shell script using /bin/sh)
* fib_go    - uses standard recursion (Go language)
* fib_go-th - uses recursion facilitated as go routines for concurrency (Go language)
